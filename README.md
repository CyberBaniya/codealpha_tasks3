## ğŸ¤– Java AI Chatbot

This project is a simple **AI-based chatbot** developed using **Java**, **JSP**, and **Servlets**. It simulates basic human-like conversations using natural language pattern matching and keyword-based logic. The chatbot can understand simple greetings, questions, and statements, and respond accordingly.

### âœ¨ Features
- Java-based backend logic
- JSP-based user interface
- Simple Natural Language Processing using keyword matching
- Deployed on Apache Tomcat
- Easily extendable with ML/NLP libraries (Stanford NLP, OpenNLP)

### ğŸ›  Tech Stack
- Java
- JSP & Servlets
- HTML/CSS (for frontend)
- Apache Tomcat (server)
- Eclipse IDE (or IntelliJ)

### ğŸ“š How It Works
The chatbot uses a set of **predefined rules and patterns** to understand user input. It converts input to lowercase, trims extra spaces, and matches keywords using `if-else` logic to generate appropriate responses.

You can expand this chatbot further by:
- Adding dynamic memory (chat history)
- Integrating with a real NLP engine (like Stanford NLP)
- Adding a database to store conversations

### ğŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Import the project as a **Dynamic Web Project** in Eclipse
3. Configure and run on **Apache Tomcat**
4. Open `http://localhost:8080/JavaChatBot/` in your browser
